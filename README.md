## üß† Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to transform raw transactional sales data into meaningful business intelligence. By integrating advanced data visualization techniques with key performance indicators (KPIs), this dashboard facilitates real-time analysis of profit drivers, regional performance, and product-level profitability trends. It is especially useful for senior management, category managers, and business analysts aiming to identify growth opportunities and cost inefficiencies.

## üìå Key Metrics & KPIs

- **Total Sales**: \$2.30 Million  
- **Quantity Sold**: 38,000 Units  
- **Total Profit**: \$286,400  

Each of these KPIs is calculated using DAX and is dynamically responsive to slicers and filters for granular exploration.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dashboard Components

### 1. **Geographical Performance Analysis**
- **State-wise Slicer** enabling dynamic filtering.
- Matrix visualization that displays **Sub-Category-wise sales** across four major U.S. regions: Central, East, South, and West.
- Enables regional benchmarking to identify high-performing markets.

### 2. **Profitability Insights**
- **Order-level profit distribution** to identify outliers and high-value transactions.
- **Sub-Category Profitability Chart** highlighting the most and least profitable product segments.
    - Example: *Chairs* and *Storage* are major profit centers, while *Tables* reflect a net loss.

### 3. **Segment and Category-Level Contribution**
- Donut charts illustrate the proportional profit contribution from:
  - **Customer Segments**: Corporate, Consumer, Home Office.
  - **Product Categories**: Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology.
  - **Geographical Regions**: A comparative breakdown to support region-specific strategy formulation.

## üìà Business Insights Derived

- The **South** and **West** regions are the top contributors to both sales and profit, suggesting focused investment in these areas.
- The **Corporate segment** yields the highest profit margins, indicating a more favorable B2B revenue stream.
- Negative profitability in certain sub-categories (e.g., *Tables*) prompts a need for margin improvement strategies or SKU rationalization.
- **Office Supplies**, despite being a mid-tier revenue driver, shows consistent profit margins‚Äîmaking it a stable contributor to overall financial health.
